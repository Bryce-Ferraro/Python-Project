# Python-Project

The goal of this project was to understand if historical data about the startup industry could inform a potential entrepreneur on **how to increase the chances of success for a startup.**

In order to do so, three research questions were investigated:
  1. Where and when to establish a startup?
  2. What are the insights from leading industries?
  3. What are the chances of success (IPO, acquired) vs. failure?

This due diligence was performed on a dataset from Kaggle called "Startup Sucess/Fail Dataset from Crunchase." One important note is that this dataset only goes to the 2015, so the most recent decade of startup data is not included in this analysis.
